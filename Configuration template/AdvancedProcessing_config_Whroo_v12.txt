[Options]
	###### General options #####
	# Set the frequency at which to perform the correlation analysis between Flux Tower and BoM stations
	#either 'all','annual','monthly' 
		corr_freq                			= "annual"
	#The Bom AWS has time stamp starting at the hour and Loggers time stamp at end of period. So we need to offset by 30 minutes
	#Usually true
		OffsetAWS30min           			= Yes            
	# Here there are options for each process in the advanced processing routines which are done in the order below. 
	# Usually you execute these all to do a complete run.  But this takes some time.  So if you have already done 
	# parts you can just update with parts you need
	# Start by getting the AWS variables first get best 3 sites.
	
	#Here enter the variable name exactly for the wind speed variable (usually Ws_CSAT or Ws)
		Ws_variable_name	     			= "Ws_CSAT"
	
	##### Options for processing is modular.  You can opt to run (YES) or not (NO) each section. Normally run from start to finish. #####
		GetL3FluxTowerData       			= Yes  	
		GetBoMAWSfiles           			= Yes

		Use_Fc_Storage           			= No
		Gapfill_fluxes_ANN       			= Yes
	
	##### Here options for Ustar_filter calculations and then the filter type that is used.  #####
	# You will need to  AT LEAST calculate the ustar you want to use in the ustar_filter_type, below. But you can calculate both Reichstein and Barr at the moment
	# Chose which of the following calculations to be done within DINGO.  Each ustar calculation is output as a separate column.  
	# Beware that the Barr et al method uses bootstrapping which can take 24 hours for 1000 iterations (recommended).  Set the number of bootstraps you want below.
		Ustar_Reichstein_calculate  		= Yes
		Ustar_Barr_calculate				= Yes
		Ustar_Barr_bootstraps				= 1000
	# Here set preference for Ustar_filter_type which are as follows
	# 1. "auto" which uses default ustar threshold scheme which is since version 12 - Barr et al. (applied annually)
	# 2. Other options are a numerical threshold manually set (i.e. 0.17), 
	# 3. Or set for Barr et al approach "ustar_Barr"
	# 4. Or use Reichstein with maximum value over entire timeseries "ustar_Reichstein_Max", 
	# 5. Or 3 month window maximum allows ustar threshold to vary "ustar_Reichstein_window"
	# Which ever variable is used it is also saved as "ustar_used"
